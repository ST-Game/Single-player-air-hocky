# Single Player Air Hockey

As an effort to demonstrate some of Unity's physical abilities, we decided to develop an air hockey game. 

Due to strict time restrictions, we could not develop an AI to play against. So, we designed 3 simple demo stages to demonstrate the physical components we took advantage of.

We started off with a paddle and a puck, just like all classic air hockey games, but found it was very difficult to play the game that way.  
So, we ended up with a 'pull and release' system, implemented using the spring joint component and a drag and drop C# script. 

The game is available at [here!](enzogorlami.itch.io/single-player-air-hockey)
